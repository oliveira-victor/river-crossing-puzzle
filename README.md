# River Crossing Puzzle

This repository contains the source code for the web game of a classic logical reasoning challenge, where you need to take three items (a wolf, a goat and a bag of veggies) across the river, but you can carry only one item at once, and you can't leave the goat alone with the veggies, neither the wolf alone with the goat on the other side of the river.
